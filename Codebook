Describing the variables in the data set 

In the dataset folder, there are the following files: 
- README.txt 
- features_info.txt: displays information about the variables used in features
- features.txt: list of all features 
- activity_labels.txt: displays the activity name with their respective label 
- train/X_train.txt: training set 
- train/y_train.txt: training labels 
- test/X_test.txt: Test set 
- test/y_test.txt: Tes labels 

Furthermore, within the datasets, the variables will be explained below: 
 The t in front of some of the variables indicate time 
 E.g. tBodyACC - XYZ , tGravityAcc-XYZ 
 The f in front of the other variables indicate frequency domain signals 
 E.g. fBodyAccMag, fBodyGyroMag 
 Some variables end with "-XYZ", these are used to indicate 3 - axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions 
 
 We used the following variables in order to complete our assignment: 
 - mean(): mean value 
 - std(): standard deviation 
 
 There are also variables that indicate the mean/average of the information  
 E.g. gravityMean, tBodyAccMean
